# 📊 Sales Prediction Using Python (Linear Regression)

This project shows how to use machine learning in Python to forecast product sales based on advertising budget. The **Linear Regression** model was employed to forecast sales based on features including advertising expenditure on TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of 10 samples, with the following columns:

- **TV**: Budget spent on Television advertisements  
- **Radio**: Budget spent on Radio advertisements  
- **Newspaper**: Budget spent on Newspaper advertisements  
- **Sales**: Product Sales (target variable)

> ⚠️ Important: The dataset is manually created on the Python script; there is no upload of external file required.

---

## 📌 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data handling  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **Scikit-Learn** – for building and evaluating machine learning model

---

## 🚀 Steps Followed

1. The dataset was created manually inside Python
2. Extremely Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Built a Simple Linear Regression model using TV budget
4. Evaluated the model using R² score
5. Plotted actual vs. predicted sales
6. (Optional) Extended to Multiple Linear Regression using all three features

---

## 📈 Model Accuracy

- **Simple Linear Regression (TV only)**: ~0.7 R² Score  
- **Multiple Linear Regression (TV, Radio, Newspaper)**: ~0.9 R² Score

---

## 🧪 Example Prediction

Sales predicted for:

- TV = 250  
- Radio = 30  
- Newspaper = 20  

**Predicted Sales**: *(from model)*

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Put in a large real-world dataset
- Give advanced models such as Random Forest or Ridge Regression a shot
- Deploy it as a web app with Streamlit
